<h1>Top 3 Frozen Coffee Blends</h1> 
<br>


<p>The FoodHUB guzzled enough coffee shakes to keep them awake for weeks. Find out which ones made the cut.</p>

 
<p>Frappuccino, Ice Blended, Coffee Freeze, Mochaccino, Toffee Mocha, Frappé—whatever name you call it, the cold-blended coffee drink is very popular here in the Philippines. So much so that when the Starbucks's famous coffee blends opens its doors to Philippines and made it a trendy beverage to be toting around .</p>

 
<p>These drinks—cold-blended coffee drinks—are the best way to get your caffeine fix when the sun is beating down your neck. Not only does it give you that much needed jolt of caffeine, it also provides you enough sugar to paste a smile on your face during your regular, crazy boring mid-afternoon meeting.</p>
 
<p>Coffee shakes are so ubiquitous that nearly every café or even fast-food restaurant chain has their own version. We enlisted the help of our staff to help us chug down as many cold-blended coffee drinks as we could in order to find out which ones are worth the pesos—and the calories.</p>
 
<p>The stores selected below are all masters of creating that perfectly balanced cold-blended coffee shake: sweet and creamy, but not too sweet that it was like drinking pure sugar, and you could still taste the coffee, because it is, after all, still all about the coffee.</p>

<h3><a href="hebrews.html" target="_self">HeBrews Cafe</a>, Chocolate Chip(P85.00)</h3>
<p>You know all that cheesy talk about people saying how all it took was one glance to know they had met their one true love? That’s how we felt when we took just one sip of HeBrews Cafe's’s Chocolate Chip. Described as “simply cold-brewed coffee, ice cream, milk and ground espresso,” there’s nothing simple about this deliciously smooth and creamy cold-blended coffee concoction. The coffee notes are clean and perfect, the milk and ice cream are rich but not cloying.</p>
 

<h3><a href="hugot.html" target="_self">Hugot Cafe</a>, Walang Tayo(P100.00)</h3>
<p>We’re huge fans of hugot lines and we all love HUgot Cafe's Cookies and Cream, which tastes like smooth, melted iced cream. Coffee connoisseurs will love how the chocolate does not overpower the coffee—you can still taste the coffee, which is still the point. It tastes good even without the whipped cream topping.</p> 


<h3><a href="gwen.html" target="_self">Gwen Coffee Shop</a>, Mocha</h3>
<p>In the amusingly very likely scenario that you need run to your next meeting with only one free hand, grab a Gwen's Mocha with a shot of espresso. The drink is made with real chocolates, so you don’t need to munch and sip. It’s a very delicious and efficient beverage. If chocolate and coffee got together, it would taste perfect like this.</p>
